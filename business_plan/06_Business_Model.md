# Business Model: Monetizing the NollyCrewHub Ecosystem

NollyCrewHub will generate revenue through a diversified business model that is designed to capture value from the entire Nollywood ecosystem. Our revenue streams are structured to be both sustainable and scalable, ensuring the long-term growth and profitability of the platform.

## 1. SaaS Subscriptions

The primary revenue stream for NollyCrewHub will be a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription model for producers, production companies, and other industry professionals who need access to our advanced project management and financial tools.

### Subscription Tiers:

We will offer a range of subscription tiers to cater to the different needs and budgets of our users:

*   **Basic (Freemium):** A free tier that provides limited access to the platform, allowing users to create a profile, browse the talent marketplace, and apply for jobs. This tier is designed to drive user acquisition and build a critical mass of talent on the platform.
*   **Producer Pro:** A premium subscription for independent producers and small production companies. This tier will provide full access to our Production OS, including script management, budgeting, and scheduling tools for a limited number of projects.

*   **Enterprise:** A custom subscription for major studios and media conglomerates, with bespoke features, dedicated support, and enterprise-grade security.

## 2. Marketplace Commissions

NollyCrewHub will take a commission on all transactions that are facilitated through our marketplace. This includes:

*   **Booking Fees:** A percentage-based fee on all talent bookings made through the platform. This fee will be charged to the producer and will be a small percentage of the total contract value.
