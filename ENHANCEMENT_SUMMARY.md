# NollyCrewHub Enhancement Summary

This document summarizes all the enhancements made to the NollyCrewHub application to improve its functionality, user experience, and testing coverage.

## 1. Enhanced AI/ML Algorithms

### New Features Implemented:
- **Enhanced Script Analysis**: More detailed breakdown of scripts including emotional tone, narrative purpose, character arcs, and comprehensive production requirements
- **Advanced Casting Recommendations**: Improved matching algorithms with bias detection, fairness analysis, and success projection modeling
- **Intelligent Schedule Optimization**: Smart production scheduling considering weather dependencies, crew fatigue, and resource allocation
- **Comprehensive Marketing Content Generation**: AI-generated taglines, social media content, press kits, and distribution strategies

### Technical Improvements:
- Created `ai-enhanced.ts` with more sophisticated algorithms
- Implemented weighted scoring systems for better recommendations
- Added comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced data structures for richer information capture

## 2. Demo Mode Separation
