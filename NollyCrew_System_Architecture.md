## 1. Overview & Goals

**Goal:** Build NollyCrew — a single, AI-powered ecosystem for Nollywood production professionals that supports the full lifecycle: idea → script → casting → crew hiring → scheduling → production → post-production → distribution and investor ROI analytics.

**Primary objectives:**

* Centralize discovery for actors & crew.
* Provide producers a full project management suite.
* Offer investors transparency and reporting.
* Use AI to speed casting, scheduling, budgeting, and marketing.
* Local-first (Nigeria) with a plan for pan-Africa then global expansion.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

**Core layers:**

* **Client layer**: Mobile apps (iOS, Android), Web app (React) for Producers/Admins, responsive web for actors/crew.
* **API Layer**: GraphQL (recommended) + REST endpoints for specific integrations.
* **Business Layer**: Microservices (or modular monolith early-stage) implementing auth, profiles, marketplace, projects, payments, AI services.
* **Data Layer**: Relational DB (Postgres) + NoSQL for sessions/real-time (Redis). Media storage (S3-compatible).
* **AI Layer**: Model orchestration, inference APIs (OpenAI, custom models), feature stores.
* **Integration Layer**: Payment gateways (Flutterwave, Paystack, Stripe), KYC providers (Smile Identity), streaming analytics partners.
* **Admin & Analytics**: Dashboard, logs, support tools.

**Deployment:** Cloud (AWS/GCP) with k8s for services, CI/CD pipelines, automated canary/blue-green releases.

---

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

**Primary roles:**

* **Guest**: Browse limited content, view public projects.
* **Actor**: Profile, auditions, reels, availability, bookings.
* **Crew**: Role-based profile (gaffer, editor, etc.), availability, bookings.
* **Producer/Director**: Create projects, manage scripts, hire talent, manage budgets.
* **Investor**: Access investor dashboards, subscribe to project updates.
* **Admin**: User verification, dispute resolution, platform moderation.

**Permission model:** Role-based access control (RBAC) with per-project permissions. Producers can grant project-level roles (assistant director, unit manager, etc.).

If you want, I can now:

* Export this as a downloadable PDF or Google Doc.
* Convert the module list into a prioritized product backlog (MVP → Beta → Growth) with user stories.
* Create detailed ER diagrams and API contract boilerplates.

Which one should I generate next?
