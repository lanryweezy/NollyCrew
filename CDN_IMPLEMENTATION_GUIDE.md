   - Select "Flexible" SSL mode for Render integration
   - Enable "Always Use HTTPS"

### Cloudflare Optimization Settings

#### Speed Optimization
1. **Auto Minify**
   - Enable JavaScript, CSS, and HTML minification
   - This reduces file sizes and improves load times

2. **Brotli Compression**
   - Enable Brotli compression for better compression ratios
   - Improves load times for text-based assets

3. **Rocket Loader**
   - Enable Rocket Loader for JavaScript optimization
   - May require testing to ensure compatibility

#### Caching Configuration
1. **Browser Cache TTL**
   - Set to "1 month" for static assets
   - Set to "1 hour" for dynamic content

2. **Cache Level**
   - Set to "Standard" for balanced performance and freshness

3. **Cache Everything**
   - Enable for static assets (images, CSS, JS)
   - Configure appropriate cache headers in your application

### Custom Caching Rules for NollyCrewHub

Add these custom caching rules in Cloudflare dashboard:

1. **Static Assets Rule**
   - Matching rule: `/*.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|svg)`
   - Setting: Cache Level = Cache Everything
   - Edge TTL: 1 month

2. **API Responses Rule**
   - Matching rule: `/api/*`
   - Setting: Cache Level = Bypass
   - This ensures API responses are always fresh

3. **HTML Pages Rule**
   - Matching rule: `/*.html`
   - Setting: Cache Level = Standard
   - Edge TTL: 1 hour

## 3. AWS CloudFront Implementation

### Prerequisites
- AWS account
- Render application deployed
- Custom domain configured

### Setup Process

1. **Create CloudFront Distribution**
   - Go to AWS CloudFront console
   - Click "Create Distribution"
   - Set "Origin Domain" to your Render URL
   - Set "Origin ID" to a descriptive name (e.g., "nollycrewhub-render")

2. **Configure Origin Settings**
   - Origin path: Leave blank
   - Protocol: HTTP only (Render handles HTTPS)
   - HTTP port: 80

3. **Configure Default Cache Behavior**
   - Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   - Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE
   - Cached HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
   - Cache key and origin requests: Use legacy cache settings

4. **Configure TTL Settings**
   - Minimum TTL: 0
   - Default TTL: 86400 (1 day)
   - Maximum TTL: 31536000 (1 year)

5. **Configure Alternate Domain Names**
   - Add your custom domain
   - Configure SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager

## 4. Application-Level Optimizations

### Static Asset Configuration

Ensure your application sets appropriate cache headers:

```javascript
// In your Express server configuration
app.use('/static', express.static('public', {
  maxAge: '1y', // 1 year for static assets
  etag: true,
  lastModified: true
}));
```

### Image Optimization

1. **Responsive Images**
   - Use `srcset` attribute for multiple image sizes
   - Implement lazy loading for images

2. **Modern Image Formats**
   - Serve WebP images to supporting browsers
   - Provide fallbacks for older browsers

### Font Optimization

1. **Font Display**
   - Use `font-display: swap` in CSS
   - Preload critical fonts

2. **Font Subsetting**
   - Only include characters used in your application
   - Split fonts by language if needed

## 5. Nollywood-Specific CDN Considerations

### Regional Performance
1. **Africa-Focused Edge Locations**
   - Ensure CDN has edge locations in or near Nigeria
   - Consider Johannesburg for South African users
   - London edge location for UK-based collaborators

### Mobile Optimization
1. **Mobile-Specific Caching**
   - Implement device-specific caching rules
   - Optimize for 3G/4G network conditions

2. **Progressive Loading**
   - Implement progressive image loading
   - Prioritize above-the-fold content

### Local Content Delivery
1. **Regional Content Mirrors**
   - Consider regional content mirrors for large files
   - Implement smart routing based on user location

## 6. Monitoring and Analytics

### CDN Performance Metrics
1. **Cache Hit Ratio**
   - Target: >80% cache hit ratio

### Origin Connectivity
1. **Origin Health Checks**
   - Monitor origin server health
