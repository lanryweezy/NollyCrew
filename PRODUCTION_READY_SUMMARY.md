- **Password strength requirements** and secure hashing
- **JWT-based authentication** with proper token management
- **NoSQL injection prevention** middleware
- **Secure cookie handling** with proper flags

### 3. Error Handling & Logging
- **Comprehensive error handling** with custom error classes
- **Structured logging** with different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- **File-based logging** with daily rotation
- **Error monitoring** with detailed context information
- **Graceful error responses** with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 4. Database & Migrations
- **Database migration system** using Drizzle ORM
- **SQL migration files** for schema versioning
- **Migration runner script** for deployment
- **Proper database indexing** for performance
- **Connection validation** in health checks

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Caching middleware** using Redis
- **Request performance monitoring** with timing metrics
- **Memory usage monitoring** and reporting
- **Efficient API responses** with proper data serialization
- **Database query optimization** through proper indexing

### 6. Monitoring & Health Checks
- **Comprehensive health check endpoint** with system metrics
- **Service health monitoring** (database, Redis, external services)
- **Performance metrics collection** (request times, error rates)
- **System resource monitoring** (memory, uptime)
- **Slow request detection** and logging

### 7. Testing Suite
- **Unit tests** for authentication service
- **Integration tests** for user and job routes
- **Mock implementations** for external dependencies
- **Test setup and teardown** for consistent testing
- **Test coverage configuration** for quality assurance

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for automated testing and deployment
- **Multi-stage build process** (test, build, deploy)
- **Environment-specific configurations** for different stages
- **Automated deployment** to Render platform
- **Dependency caching** for faster builds

### 9. Deployment Documentation
- **Complete deployment guide** with step-by-step instructions
- **Environment setup documentation** with all required variables
- **Docker deployment options** for containerized environments
- **Scaling recommendations** for production workloads
- **Maintenance procedures** for ongoing operations
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues

### 10. Containerization
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** for optimized production images
- **Docker Compose configuration** for local development
- **Health checks** for container monitoring
- **Non-root user** for security best practices
- **Volume management** for persistent data
